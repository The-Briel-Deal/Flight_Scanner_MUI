# Flight Scanner
This is a flight scanner app I'm building right now. The idea is that users can put in their where they want to go, their time they can go, and their budget and it will notify them via text and email once their is a flight that meets all three of those criteria.
## Technologies
### On the backend:
I'm uses Kiwi's Tequila API for getting flight prices. Twilio for texting users. And SMTP for notifying users. All of the API calls are done with fetch. And Firestore Realtime DB for the Database.
### On the frontend:
I'm using React for state and building UI, Tailwind & Flexbox for styling, and MUI for things like the date selector.
## How do I use this!?!
All you need to make your own build is to get a free API key from Twilio, Kiwi, and Firebase. Once you do that just build out the secrets.js file and you'll be ready to fly! Also I should be putting up a production site for this after a bit more work.
